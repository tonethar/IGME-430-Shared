# HW - Node Simple Web API


# I. Overview

- We are going to create a simple [*Web API*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API) using node and npm
- We are going to deploy this server to Heroku using Git & Github
- The web service serves up a random joke in JSON format
- Below are screenshots of the landing page for the service, the `/staleJoke` and `/randomJoke` endpoints, and a client app that uses the web service

# II. Getting ready

1) You need a console app to type commands into:
  - On Mac OS you can use the built in *Terminal* app
  - On Windows you can use one of these:
    - [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701)
    - GitBash (this also installs git) - https://www.stanleyulili.com/git/how-to-install-git-bash-on-windows/
    - Powershell - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell
    
2) You must have node & npm installed - see the install instructions here --> https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

3) If you are going to deploy this to app to Heroku you will need:
  - A Github account (free!) - https://education.github.com/pack
  - Git - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
  - A Heroku account (free!) - https://signup.heroku.com
  
# III. Get started
